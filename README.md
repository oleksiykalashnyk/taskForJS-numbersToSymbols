The project was implemented during Javascript training by 
**Olek Kalashnyk**

-------------------------------
### Task:
Create a program that implements character output as a string, where the number of characters will be the input number.

#### How it works:
Example # 1:
```javascript
Input: 5
Output: 
"#"
"# @"
"# @ *"
"# @ * #"
"# @ * # @"
```
Example # 2:
```javascript
Input: 7
Output: 
"#"
"# @"
"# @ *"
"# @ * #"
"# @ * # @"
"# @ * # @ *"
"# @ * # @ * #"

```

------------------------------

### The requirement to execute:
###### The program must accept numbers from 1 to 999999999.
###### Output to the browser (in any form).
